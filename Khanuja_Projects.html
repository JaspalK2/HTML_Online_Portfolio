                  <p class="text-break indent">For Horde Lord, Me and Archit had to figure out what would we</p>
                  make the player defend. We got our inspiration from the games that have waves of monsters because it seemed to be a good idea. Later on we decided to make the player have a blowing animation every time he tried to push the monsters away. I designed the code while Archit had designed the graphics, I believe that there were a total of three drawings to make it look like a proper animation. To make many monsters spawn in random directions, we had to have one origin monster so that we could use clones of it to make it look like a lot of monsters. So we just moved the real monster to the corner of the game where you cannot see it. It is quite simplistic but very effective. The first and second wave worked out perfectly, but we saw that later on it got too hard for the player to compete against the monsters, so we decided to add powerups, for example one of the power ups made the player just gets twice as big so that it could take out more monsters with one blow. There was also documentation for this project that will be provided <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQ429Zf6r_1PjfGFPa0CBSt6lzL2ZGtVqVRz7DE4rfc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. We ended up scoring a 91% on this project and that was pretty good because this was my first project that I made scratch. From this project, I learnt how to animate objects and how to spawn sprites at random spots, and the most important thing: how to make elements invisible. This later gave me an idea to make a 3d game and that was also pretty cool. As you could look around the screen.

                  <p class="text-break indent">For this project, I had to determine what was the most efficient way</p>
                  to determine how an individual could get an accurate reading on their driving ability throughout a drive. My inspiration came from a previous project of mine regarding the creation of an air-powered turbine (designed to help reduce carbon emmisions by using air instead). While the idea seemed promising, there were a surplus of issues that sprung up; for instance I had to figure out which languge would be best suited for such a task, which form of graphical analysis could I use, and the developemnt of a "front-end" or rather a GUI for this program. Luckily, I found that there were various extensive libraries in java that could be utilized for the exact items that I needed. To be specific, I used Java Swing for most if not all of my GUI, javaFX for alot of my plot graphs and end result displays, and multiple Java file reading basic libraries. I found that file reading was key to my project as it enabled me to not only store user data, but also store it for later usage in calculations on driving efficiency and gas consumtion. Additionally, I reffered to the Bureau of Transportation for a large amount of my data sets on Road conditions, Total miles of Road, and other factors for all States in the US. The addition of data sets furthur developed the accuracy for my data calculations and made them more reliable. Currently I am developing a new aspect to determine live traffic interpretation so that I can help my program remove outliers in data sets.

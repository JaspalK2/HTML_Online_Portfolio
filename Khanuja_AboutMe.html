            <p class="works">Ever wonder how much effort it actually takes to make complex code in order to make your </p>
            favorite website. The answer? Thousands and thousands of code just dedicated to an application for example: youtube, twitter, games. These kinds of questions always intrigue me and make me ponder: Do I have what It takes to be a software developer? After extensive research I have come to conclude that I do I have what it takes. I would say that by the time I graduate from highschool, I should complete a certain degree of math and science as you need both of them. Later on, I would strive for a degree in computer science or even quantum physics allowing me to get a job in the tech field.</p>
            <p class="text-break work">
            <p class="works">Through my experiences in all grade levels, I think that 8th grade really showed off my skills</p>
            and qualities, for example, in our 8th grade science class, we had to make a functioning electric car without any resources or guides so to speak. This took a long time, and we spend a good amount of time doing it. Sadly, one of our teammates accidentally knocked over the prototype and broke the car. We got really stressed as the project was due today, but I had planned out this scenario in my head already so I had made a backup car. This ended up becoming the fastest in terms of speed. So not only did we win the competition but we got a good grade because of my reliability.</p>
            <p class="text-break work">
            <p class="works">An additional trait I have is determination. In most soccer clubs, kids would get introduced to</p>
            it by their parents at a young age like maybe 6 or 7. But I was an exception because I came to america when I was in 3rd grade and had no prior knowledge when it came to soccer. Once I decided to take soccer as an actual sport I would play, I joined a club in 6th grade, which only gave me 3 years of experience until now.I remembered that I was quite bad at the start, but with my determination, I managed to even outperform some of the kids that had been in the club for over 6 years. One trait that made me useful to my teams was that being an utility player, which meant that I could be placed anywhere on the field and I could still play with very good performance. Not to mention I am also the fastest runner on our team.</p>
            <p class="text-break work">
            <p class="works">Leadership is yet another one of my skills. An example of this was when in our science class,</p>
            we were assigned a project where we had to make a roller coaster out of a bunch of paper. At first our group was struggling because they had no idea about who would be assigned what part. But after watching my teamates struggle, I decided to step up and tell each and every one of my group members what to do. Later on, we ended up with a very cool looking roller coaster. Our group even outwitted other groups in terms of style, quality and overall looks.</p>
            <p class="text-break work">
            <p class="works">To conclude, I have many traits that make me a reliable person such as reliability,</p>
            determination, and leadership. All these traits together make a very well mannered and mature individual in my eyes. I hope that you can understand where I am going with this.
